# resposive-card
three cards are there in my code are made by using HTML and CSS , all three cards are responsive like when user is hover on any card it will response as a deck card.
For my project, I created a visually appealing and functional layout using HTML and CSS, featuring three responsive cards that adjust seamlessly to different screen sizes. Each card is designed with a clean, modern aesthetic and contains relevant content such as an image, a title, a short description, and a call-to-action button. The cards are arranged in a horizontal layout on larger screens, but on smaller devices, they stack vertically for optimal viewing. I used CSS Flexbox to ensure the layout is flexible and easily adapts to varying screen widths, and incorporated media queries to fine-tune the responsiveness. The cards also have hover effects to add interactivity, enhancing user experience. Overall, this project showcases my ability to create responsive and dynamic designs using basic HTML and CSS techniques, ensuring that the design is both user-friendly and visually attractive across devices.
